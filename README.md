# Nick's Ray Tracer

A ray tracer written in Rust following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. This is a follow-up to my [previous attempt](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend) where I did the
same exact thing but it was written in C instead.

I'm hoping to complete all three books for this project, and afterwards I might
even do some more stuff like making it multithreaded or something. Below are some
example outputs so far.
