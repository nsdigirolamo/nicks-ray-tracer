# Nick's Ray Tracer

A ray tracer written in Rust following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. This is a follow-up to my [previous attempt](https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend) where I did the
same exact thing but it was written in C instead.

I'm hoping to complete all three books for this project, and afterwards I might
even do some more stuff like making it multithreaded or something. Below are some
example outputs so far.

    The below image is 1920x1080, 1000 samples per pixel, and max bounce depth 
    of 500. It's the final scene for the first book in the series. There is no 
    multi-threading or anything like that so it took 2 hours and 13 minutes to 
    render on my AMD Ryzen 3600 @ 3.6 GHz.
